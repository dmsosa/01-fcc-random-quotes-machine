# 🧠 Random Quote Machine

A simple yet responsive Random Quote Machine built using **React**. This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Frontend Libraries Certification**.

Each time the user clicks the button, a new random quote is displayed along with the author. There's also a "Tweet Quote" button that allows users to share the current quote directly on Twitter.
